I'm passionate about technology, cloud and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing masters in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at [Otto-von-Guericke University](https://www.ovgu.de). My journey in technology began when I was in bachelors. Since then, I've been learning about tech, ML, and AI. In addition, I have an interest in politics, religion, and the Indian Constitution.
